Hi, Iâ€™m @albinoonline

I'm only 10-15% sure what i'm doing at any given time, sometimes as high as 50% on rare occasions. Ive been making a From The Depths BP editor for a "lil bit".
Ive only spen a few weeks on it, but its been so spead out becouse of my work. New stuff will come, now that FTD is gatting a basic editor, i need to "inovate" or something.
I am MTA certified in HTML and CSS, aswell as Javascript, (typed that way becouse HTML and CSS are one cert).
