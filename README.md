Hi, Iâ€™m @albinoonline

I'm only 10-15% sure what i'm doing at any given time, sometimes as high as 50% on rare occasions. I make webtoys when i feel like spending hours on a project that will only save me whole **minutes** any given week.
I am MTA certified in HTML and CSS, aswell as Javascript, (typed that way becouse HTML and CSS are one cert).
