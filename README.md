Hi, Iâ€™m @albinoonline

I'm only 10-15% sure what i'm doing at any given time, sometimes as high as 50% on rare occasions. I make webtoys when i feel like spending hours on a project that will only save me whole **minutes** any given week.
I am MTA certified in Javascript, HTML and CSS, and boring stuff like networking fundimentals and the windows operating system.
